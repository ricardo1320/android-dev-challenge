## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Scrolling Twitter I found out Google launched last Wednesday (24/Feb/2021) the Beta of Jetpack Compose.
And then I asked myself: What is Jetpack Compose?
After watching Google's videos explaining it, my motivation was huge. As I read about the #AndroidDevChallenge,
my mind started thinking only about it.

I am proud of the result; from knowing zero about Jetpack Compose to get this UI in about a day.
Most importantly, I had a lot of fun coding!
